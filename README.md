#Service Fusion Technical Test

##Requirements
"Write and deploy a small native android application to store a list of persons, containing the following fields: firstname, lastname, date of birth and zip-code. Weâ€™re looking for basic CRUD functionality. Any bells and whistles are welcome. The app should store the data on firebase (or similar). Provide the APK, source code and access to the firebase instance along with your application."

##Current State
The main screen reads from a Firebase instance, and new records can be added there. The app uses material design and input validation.
Update and delete functionality still needs to be added.
