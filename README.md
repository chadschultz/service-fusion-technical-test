#Service Fusion Technical Test

##Requirements
"Write and deploy a small native android application to store a list of persons, containing the following fields: firstname, lastname, date of birth and zip-code. Weâ€™re looking for basic CRUD functionality. Any bells and whistles are welcome. The app should store the data on firebase (or similar). Provide the APK, source code and access to the firebase instance along with your application."

##Current State
Completed.
The main screen is a scrolling list of Person objects. Tap one to go to the details screen where it can be viewed, updated and deleted.
The details screen uses input validation and checks before losing work (for new or changed data). Existing entries can be deleted.
Overall, I have strived to pay attention to detail in the app.
Potential improvements? Perhaps to delete entries from the main screen, using a long press that allows the user to check multiple entries to delete at once, or swiping list rows for a "delete" leave-behind. Or swiping on the detail view to go to previous or next items. Those aren't really necessary though.
